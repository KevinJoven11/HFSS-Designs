# HFSS Firts Principles

This repository has the basics information (step-by-step guide) to design, execute and analyze the basic information of a given system using HFSS. The main idea is to explain through screenshots and plot the idea of how to implement and begin with HFSS.

Current projects:
- Stripline design and electric field calculation on a 3D/2D surface.
- Coplanar Waveguide, same analysis as Stripline.
- Transmon qubit. Help by Qiskit Metal.
